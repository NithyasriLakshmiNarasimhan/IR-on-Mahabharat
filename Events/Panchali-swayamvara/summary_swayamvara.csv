1,"Arjuna asked Gandharva if Veda-knowing Brahmana is worthy to be appointed as a priest.He replied that he is, because he is well-versed in Vedic literature.Arjuna then asked for a priest to be chosen."
2,"Dhaumya, the younger brother of Devala, is engaged there in ascetic penances.Gandharva suggests appointing him as a priest in Utkochaka as a shrine in the woods.He agrees to do so if he is appointed."
3,"The Pandavas went to Utkochaka, the sacred asylum of Dhaumya, and they got the blessings of Brahmana, their priest.He made them his Yajamanas (spiritual disciples).Then they went to the Swayamvara of the Princess of Panchala."
4,"The Pandavas are going to Panchala to see Draupadi's marriage.The Brahmanas are coming from Ekachakra to the abode of Drupada in the country of the Panchalas to see the Swayamvara.They will also be there to witness the festivities of the wedding of the daughter of Yajnasena, who will choose a husband from the invited princes."
5,"Brahmanas will go with Yudhishthira to witness Swayamvara's jubilee to witness the maiden's maiden's wedding.Yudhistthira is excited about it.  .  ""Yeu "
6,The Pandavas entered the country of the Panchalas ruled by the king Drupada.They took up quarters in the house of a potter and adopted the Brahmanical profession.No one recognised them during their stay in Drupado's capital.
7,"Yajnasena always wanted to bestow his daughter on Kiriti (Arjuna), the son of Pandu.O Janamejaya, the king of Panchala, made a very stiff bow that was incapable of being bent by anyone except Arjuna.Drupada said, 'He that will string this bow and with these well-adorned arrows shoot the mark above the machine shall obtain my daughter'"
8,King Drupada proclaimed the Swayamvara.King Duryodhana and the Kurus accompanied by Kama came to his capital.The monarch entered the grand amphitheatre by the north-eastern gate.It was surrounded by mansions with high walls and a moat.The windows of the mansions were covered with net works of gold.The walls were set with diamonds and precious costly carpets and cloths.
9,The Pandavas and the Brahmanas were watching the performance of the king of the Panchalas. Drupada's daughter entered the amphitheatre with a dish of gold and a garland of flowers. Drupada's son recited to his sister the names and lineages of the assembled lords of the earth.
10,"""Dhrishtadyumna said, 'Duryodhana, Durvisaha, Durmukha, Vivinsati, Vikarna, Saha, Duhsasana, Yuyutsu, Vayuvega, Kanakayu, Virochana, Suvarcha, and Kanakadhwaja have come from Dhritarashtra's land.Sakuni, Sauvala, Vrisaka, and Vrihadvala of the king Gandhara have also come .Aswatthaman and Bhoja of the Kshatriyas have come."
11,"Vaisampayana describes the scene of the wedding of Draupadi in which the Kshatriyas, princes, celestials, the Adityas, the Vasus, the Aswins, the Swadhas, the Marutas, and Kuvera with Yama were present."
12,"Karna, the foremost wielder of the bow, strung the bow and placed the arrows on the string. Draupadi refused to choose a Suta for her lord, so Karna threw the bow aside and drew a circle around the bow."
13,"Sisupala, Jarasandha, Jishnu, the son of Kunti, and Salya, the king of Madra, fell upon their knees trying to string the bow.They became subjects of derisive talk, but foremost of heroes Jishna managed to do it."
14,Brahmanas were displeased when the monarchs had stopped stringing the bow.Arjuna took up the bow and strung it with great exertion and resolve.Vaisampayana explains that there is nothing in the world that Brahmanas of all mortal men cannot accomplish.
15,Drupada wanted to bestow his daughter on a Brahmana.All the monarchs who had been invited to the Swayamvara were filled with wrath.Vaisampayana said that the Vedic declaration is well-known.The Brahmanas have no claim in respect of a Kshatriya damsel.
16,"The Kuru princes Bhima, Jishnu, Damodara, Valadeva, Vrikodara and Yudhishthira, along with their mother Pritha, escaped from the clutches of the Kaurava monarchs."
17,"Arjuna, Bhima, Karna and Radheya were fighting against the Brahmanas.Arjuna fired hundreds of arrows at them.Karna, the son of Vikartana (Surya), pieced him with his sharp arrows.They both became invisible."
18,"Bhima, Karna, Salya and Vrikodara engaged in a fight.Bhima, the foremost of the Kuru heroes, hurled Saly a distance.Bhimasena surprised all by the dexterity of his feat.The othermonarchs were alarmed and surrounded Bhima and surrounded him."
19,Krishna convinced the assembled monarchs to abandon the fight against Bhima and Dhananjaya.Bhima was the son of Kunti.The princess of Panchala was the bride of a Brahmana.The festive scene was terminated in the victory of the Brahmanas.
20,"Kunti's sons were late in returning from theireleemosynary round.Jishnu, accompanied by a body of Brahmanas, entered the abode of the potter in the late afternoon.Kunti was worried that her sons had been killed."
21,"The sons of Pritha returned from the potter's abode and presented Yajnaseni as the alms they had obtained to their mother.Kunti was there within the room and saw not her sons, so she said, 'Enjoy ye all (what ye have obtained)."
22,"Yudhishthira consoled Kunti, and addressed Dhananjaya, said, 'By thee, O Phalguna, hath Yajnaseni been won.It is proper that we all should wed her."
23,"Arjuna doesn't want to be a participant in sin.Arjuna wants to be married first, followed by Bhima, Nakula, Vrikodara, the twins and Sahadeva, and then Arjun.Arjun wants Panchala to command them as helikest."
24,"The Pandavas all looked at Draupadi, the princess of Panchala.Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, understood the meaning of Krishna-Dwaipayana's words.The king, from fear of a division among the brothers, addressed all of them and said that Drauupadi will be the common wife of them all."
25,"Krishna and Valadeva went to the potter's house.They saw Ajatasanu (Yudhishthira) and his younger brothers passing the splendour of fire sitting around him.Vasudeva touched the feet of Kunti, the son of Ajamida.The Pandavas, the sons of Pandu, saw them and were delighted."
26,"The Panchala prince hid himself in the potter's house.Bhima, Jishnu, and the illustrious twins, cheerfully gave everything to Yudhishthira.Kunti, the daughter of Drupada, divided the food into six parts and divided it into half for Bhima and half for himself."
27,Dhristadyumna went to Drupada to report what had happened at the potter's abode.The king of Panchala was sad because Krishna had taken away his daughter.Arjuna took up the bow and shot the mark.
