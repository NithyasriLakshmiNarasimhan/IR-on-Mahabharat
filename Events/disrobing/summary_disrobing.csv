5,Draupadi is angry at Pratikamin for accusing the king of staking his wife on dice.Pratikaamin claims that the king was intoxicated and had no other object to stake his wife with than dice.Draupadi believes otherwise.

11,"""Morality is the one highest object in the world.If cherished, it will dispense blessings to us.I am ready to do what those elderly and virtuous people conversant with morality will definitely tell me.  ""Draupadi said, 'The great ordainer of the world hath, indeed, ordained'."
12,"The Suta came back to the assembly and repeated the words of Draupadi, but all sat with faces downwards, knowing the eagerness and resolution of Dhritarashtra's son.Vaisampayana continued,--""the Suta, hearing these words of Yajnaseni, came back."

14,"Duryodhana ordered Dussasana to bring the daughter of Yajnasena, Krishna, to the assembly.He dragged Draupadi by her long, blue and wavy locks and dragged her before the assembly, while she was praying to Krishna and Vishnu."
15,"Vaisampayana was dragged by Dussasana, the modest Krishna.She is ashamed to be dragged in such a way in front of the assembly.She can't stay before them in this state.She believes that the virtue of Bharata has disappeared."
16,"Krishna was dragged by her lords, the Pandavas, to the assembly.Dussasana called her 'Slave, Slave', Karna, Sakuni and Duryodhana approved of them.Bhishma cannot decide whether a wife can stake the wealth belonging to others or not."
17,"Draupadi said that the king was made to play dice with skilful, wicked, deceitful and desperate gamblers.He could not understand their tricks, but he has now done so.Draupadi also said that Kurus are the lords of their sons and daughters-in-law."

20,"'Arjuna heard Bhimasena saying that Arjuna's high morality has been destroyed by cruel foes.  He was summoned by the foe and he played dice against his will, which is not in accordance with the usage of the Kshatriyas."

25,"Bhima's words were never before uttered by other men, nor will anybody in the future ever utter them.Bhima said, if having spoken these words I do not accomplish them hereafter, let me not obtain the region of my deceased ancestors.If I don't drink Bhima's life-blood, I won't obtain the regions of my ancestors."
26,"Vaisampayana tells the story of Bhima, Draupadi, Vidura and the Kauravas in the assembly.Vidura is the master of the science of morality.He tells the assembly to quench the fire and cool down the person who asks a question without answering it."

31,"Draupadi was dragged forcibly by Dussasana and deprived of his senses, but she had a high duty to perform and she had not done it yet.She saluted the reverend seniors in the assembly of Kurus for helping her to do it."
32,"Draupadi wept in the assembly of the Kurus, because she was dragged and beaten.Vaisampayana said that Draupadi was undeserving of such treatment and fell down on the ground.   ""Dragged with greater force than before""."
33,"Yudhishthira, the daughter-in-law of the Kauravas, is brought before the assembly today.She wants to know if she is a serving-maid or a wife of a king.She is upset that she is forced to enter the public court."
34,"""The course of morality is subtle.Even the illustrious wise in this world fail to understand it always.As all the Kurus have become slaves of covetousness and folly, the destruction of this race will happen soon.The family into which Bhishma has been admitted as a daughter-in-law is such that those who are born in it never deviate from the paths of virtue and morality."
35,"""I am a little bit overweight.I am not a very good conversationalist.I have a lot of problems with vocabulary.I do not know how to talk to people.I don't have a good vocabulary. I am a bit of a talkative person."

40,"Yajnaseni is now the wife of a slave.Bhishma, Vidura, and the preceptor of the Kurus (Drona) are independent, but Bhimasena, Yudhishthira, Sahadeva, and Arjuna are slaves."
41,"Vaisampayana tells the story of Bhima's reaction to the king's words.Bhima is angry at the king, because Bhima had played a staking with a princess and his people have entered the state of servitude.  "
42,"Duryodhana asked Bhimasena if he regards Krishna as unwon.Bhima, Arjuna and the twins are under Bhim's sway.He uncovered his left thigh and showed it to Draupadi in her very sight.She was angry."
43,"The sons of Dhritarashtra are arguing in the assembly about a lady of the royal household.Vidura warns the Bharatas that if virtue is persecuted, the assembly will be polluted.If Yudhishthira had staked her before he was himself, he would have been regarded as her master."
44,"Duryodhana is willing to abide by the words of Bhima, Arjuna and the twins, if they say that Yudhishthira is not their master.Yajnaseni will then be freed from her state of bondage."

48,"Draupadi wants Yudhishthira to be freed from slavery.She doesn't want her son Prativindhya to be called the child of a slave, because he was a prince and was nurtured by kings, so it's not proper to call him a slave's child."
49,"Dhritarashtra will give her a second boon, because she doesn't deserve only one.She should ask him for another one.   ""O auspicious one, let it be as thou sayest and I will give it to thee."
50,"Draupadi asks the king to free Bhimasena and Dhananjaya and thetwins from their bondage.  .     - King of the Universe. - ""O king, free them from bondage""."
51,Dhritarashtra wants his daughter-in-law to ask him for a third boon.She has already been honoured with two boons.She is the foremost of Dhritarra's daughters-in'-law.She wants to ask for the third boon as she has been honoured twice.

55,"Vaisampayana's wife insulted Arjuna's wife, so Bhimasena had a son born from her, but it was of no service to them.Vaisambayana believes that the son will not be of any use to them in the end."
56,"""Superior persons, O Bharata, never prate about harsh words that may or may not be uttered by inferior men.People that have earned respect for themselves, even if they are able to retaliate, should remember not the acts of hostility done by their enemies, but only their good deeds."
57,Bhima wants to kill all his enemies and rule the whole earth.Arjuna pacifies his elder brother Bhima.Yudhishthira forbade Bhima from killing his enemies.Bhima approaches his uncle Dhritarashtra and pleads for peace.

59,"Yudhishthira and Bharata want to remain always in obedience to their king, King Bharata, and obey him as he tells them what to do.They want to be his slaves.They are obeying him as his master. "
